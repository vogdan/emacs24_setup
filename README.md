emacs24_setup
===========

Initially intended as a simple IDE for Python, this setup should provide code browsing (via ECB) and code copletion (via auto-complete and ac-python) for at least `python`, `bash` and `tcl`.

Tested and worked on & `24.3.1 (Linux Mint)` (**64 bit**). 

   
#### How To
```  
    1. Downolad repo in your home path
    2. mv emacs_setup .emacs.d
    3. ln -s .emacs.d/dot-emacs .emacs
    4. Enjoy.
```


#### Troubleshooting

If code browsing is not working, grab the latest `ecb` from [here](https://github.com/alexott/ecb/), edit `Makefile` and run `make`.
